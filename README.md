# Meta Noughts and Crosses

Meta Noughts and Crosses (aka [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](wiki)) is a tactical twist on the classic game. Make no mistake - it is easy to learn but difficult to master! MNAC can be played via the terminal or UI.

It also has a Discord bot on a separate branch which is currently not being maintained.

## Installation and setup

Requires Python 3.5 or above.

You can run `terminal.py` straight away. If you want the GUI version, install:

`pip install numpy Pillow`

Then run `tk.py` for a Tkinter-powered UI.
